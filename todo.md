# Feature Requests

Sorted by ease of implementation (easiest to hardest):

- [x] Album click navigation: Clicking on the album in the player bar navigates to the album page (default behavior - can be changed in settings)
- [ ] Fix button overlap: Next track and casting buttons overlap on some screen resolutions
- [ ] Reduce API calls: Minimize unnecessary API calls throughout the app
- [ ] Editor's Picks: Create a JSON file of curated album IDs with metadata for the home screen. Include an option to disable in settings to avoid extra API calls.

- [ ] Volume curve option: Add setting to switch between exponential and linear volume scaling
- [ ] Custom fonts: Allow users to change fonts in settings or add custom fonts from Google Fonts or direct links

- [ ] Audio effects: Add ability to change pitch and playback speed, plus effects like reverb, delay, and bitcrushing
- [ ] Customizable EQ: Allow users to change the number of EQ bands and their range (-30 to 30), with a drag-to-adjust interface similar to FL Studio's velocity editor

[ ] SoundCloud support: Integrate SoundCloud through SoundCloak
